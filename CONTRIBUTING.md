# Contributing to Prodovo code

Contributions to the Prodovo codebase are done using the pull model.

Contributions can take the form of new components/features, changes to existing features, tests, documentation (such as developer guides, user guides, examples, or specifications), bug fixes, optimizations or just good suggestions.

The Prodovo development team will review all issues and contributions submitted by all developers in the first in, first out order. During the review we might require clarifications from the contributor. 

## Contribution requirements

1. Contributions must adhere to [Magento coding standards](http://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v1.0/coding-standards/bk-coding-standards.html).
2. Pull requests (PRs) must be accompanied by a meaningful description of their purpose. Comprehensive descriptions increase the chances of a pull request to be merged quickly and without additional clarification requests.
